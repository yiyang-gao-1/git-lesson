# Welcome to my homepage


I am now working as the Quantitative Social Science Research Associate at the University of Sheffield's Methods Institute.

My research journey began with studying educational segregation during my PhD at the University of Exeter (2018-2023), where I developed novel multi-group, multi-scale analytical frameworks. This work revealed how spatial inequalities create cascading disadvantages across education, transport, and health domains.

I am now pivoting toward computational health geography, focusing on using advanced quantitative methods and AI/ML to understand and address spatial health inequalities. My current work explores the intersection of ethnicity, space, and social outcomes through innovative applications of MAIHDA (Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy).

Research Interests: Spatial Inequalities, Computational Social Science, Health Geography, Intersectionality, Advanced Quantitative Methods, Population Geography
